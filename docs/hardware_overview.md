## OLED 

The OLED screen has a pixel resolution of 128 x 64, a panel size of 304.5 x 23.0 x 1.4 (mm), and an active area of 29.42 x 14.7 (mm). There is more information in the [datasheet](assets/board_files/1.3inch-SH1106-OLED_Datasheet.pdf).

## Power

Ideally, power is supplied by the Qwiic connector, but the 3V3 and GND pins have been broken out to plated through holes on the side of the board (along with the Clock and Data Lines). Input voltage should not exceed <b>3.3V</v>, as there is no voltage regulation on this breakout.

## Qwiic connectors

The board includes Qwiic connectors that provide power and I<sup>2</sup>C connectivity simultaneously.

For users that need to solder directly to the board, the pins are also broken out on the edge PTH. The I<sup>2</sup>C data and clock lines are also tied to 2.2kÎ© pull-up resistors.

        How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces</a>
	</p>


### Address Jumper

The SparkFun Qwiic OLED 1.3in board has a default I<sup>2</sup>C address of 0x3D, but by cutting the address jumper on the back of the board, you can select 0x3C.

### I<sup>2</sup>C Jumper


Like our other Qwiic boards, the SparkFun Qwiic OLED 1.3in comes equipped with pull-up resistors on the clock and data pins. If you are daisy-chaining multiple Qwiic devices, you will want to cut this jumper; if multiple sensors are connected to the bus with the pull-up resistors enabled, the parallel equivalent resistance will create too strong of a pull-up for the bus to operate correctly. As a general rule of thumb, disable all but one pair of pull-up resistors if multiple devices are connected to the bus. To disable the pull up resistors, use an X-acto knife to cut the joint between the jumper pads highlighted below.

??? tip "Need more measurements?"
	For more information about the board's dimensions, users can download the [Eagle files](assets/board_files/Qwiic_OLED_1.3in.zip) for the 1" x 1" board, or the [Eagle files](assets/board_files/Qwiic_OLED_1.3in.zip) for the Mini board. These files can be opened in Eagle and additional measurements can be made with the dimensions tool.
