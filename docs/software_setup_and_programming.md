    ### Arduino IDE

    This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino IDE and an library, please review the following tutorials.

    - [Installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide)
    - [Installing an Arduino Library](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)



SparkFun has leveraged our existing OLED library to work with the SparkFun Qwiic OLED 1.3 board. If you haven't already worked with our OLED boards, you can obtain this library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for "Qwiic OLED" and installing the latest version. If you prefer downloading libraries manually, you can grab them from the GitHub Repository.
